    This will just be a simple scrolling page. Start with lemonade stand, 
    scroll to reveal the real treasure which is grapes. <br>
    Also grapes are my favorite fruit.
    <br> So lemonade stand (which links to video), maybe a shiny arrow
    pointing down at the bottom of the page, indicating user to scroll.
    <br>Then go to treasure chest, which will have banner saying "open for lemonade."
    <br> Then when the treasure chest is clicked -> show grapes and happy duck.
